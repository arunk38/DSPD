/*
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
 * you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
 * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 *
 * Start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
 * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *	Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 *	Output: 3
 *	Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
